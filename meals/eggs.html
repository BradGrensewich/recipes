    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Cover a plate with baking paper and lay bacon on top it strips not touching eachother</li>
      <li>Sprinkle brown sugar on bacon</li>
      <li>Heat oven to 400f and put plate in. Set timer 7 1/2 minutes</li>
      <li>Chop up onion and green pepper into fine pieces</li>
      <li>Cut english muffins in half and prepare them for the toaster (but not yet)</li>
      <li>Heat a pan with butter so that it can be used when timer goes off</li>
      <li>When time goes off, take plate out of oven and flip all bacon, return to oven and set a new alarm for the same time</li>
      <li>Crack 3 eggs into heated pan <strong>not on the burner</strong></li>
      <li>Turn burner to max heat</li>
      <li>Altertenate pan on burner and pan off burner every 10 seconds, constantly stirring <e>(don't let the eggs sit)</e></li>
      <li>When eggs begin to solidify <em>(this will happen quickly)</em>, remove from burner and add cold cream cheese to cool them off. Mix</li>
      <li>Add diced onion and green pepper. Spice to taste w salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Place english muffins in toaster</li>
      <li>Return to alternating 10 seconds on and off burner until desired consistency is reached <en>(earlier is better)</en></li>
      <li>Once english muffins pops, spread cream cheese, then spread eggs</li>
      <li>The timer should be done right about now. So take your bacon out of the oven and place the strips on the eggs</li>
      <li>This was probably intense, but if you kept up it was worth it. Enjoy!</li>
